ESSEC is intended to bring together students researching various problems related to software engineering so they can introduce their research to the local research community, engage in collaborative discussion on each otherâ€™s research, and build their professional (and personal) networks.
Students interested in presenting their work should complete the form <a className="text-primary font-bold" href="https://forms.gle/MDLmNnEvnk3XV3UX9" target="_blank">here</a>
<br></br>
Submissions and presentations must be made by students or postdocs. <b>A letter of support from your academic advisor is a required part of the submission.</b> 
Student research in any field that has methods, outcomes, or implications relevant to software engineering is welcome. Accepted submissions will be presented as either posters or talks.

 There will be no registration fee and lunch will be provided. Students and postdocs are encouraged to consult with their supervisors about potential reimbursement of travel expenses.</p>
